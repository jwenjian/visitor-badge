# visitor-badge

**__RECREATION RECOMMENDATION:__ There exists a recreation of Visitor Badge which is written entirely from scratch but with EXTRA features and uses Golang instead. There is nearly ZERO drawback to trying this project as it transfers the same visitor count over. More details could be found [here](https://github.com/Nathan13888/visitor-badge)**
---

**The service is now deployed under a free version of glitch, so it will down if too many requests in the same time and I currently have no suitable credit card to upgrade my glitch to pro**

You can:

1. fork this project and deploy under your glitch account and let it working for yourself, it should be enough.
2. use [hits](https://github.com/dwyl/hits) instead
3. consider a donation :-)

Sorry for the inconvenience.

If you deployed forked project to your stable server and want to provide a free, stable service, which is very kind, please raise an issue to tell me so I can list your service url here:

> Before you do that, **DO update the md5_key in .env file to `guess_what`** so that former users will not lose their count, otherwise the count will start from 1.
