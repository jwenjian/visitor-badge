# visitor-badge

**The service is now deployed under a free version of glitch, so it will down if too many requests in the same time and I currently have no suitable credit card to upgrade my glitch to pro**

You can:

1. fork this project and deploy under your glitch account and let it working for yourself, it should be enough.
2. use [hits](https://github.com/dwyl/hits) instead
3. consider a donation :-)

Sorry for the inconvenience.
