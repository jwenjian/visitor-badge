**Since the current public instance is deployed under a FREE version of Glitch, it may go offline if there are too many requests at the same time. Sorry for the inconvenience.**

## Alternatives to using the public instance

<!-- TODO: add link to deploy Glitch instance -->
1. **Deploy your own instance**
    - Fork this project and deploy under a personal glitch account, it should be more than enough for a few people.
    - Host a fork on a VPS or some type of server.
2. **Use HITS**: https://github.com/dwyl/hits
3. **Consider a donation :-)**: A donation could help upgrade the current public instance.

**NOTE**: If you deployed a forked project to a stable server and could kindly share this with others which could be greatly appreciated, please raise an issue to list your URL here.

> Before you do that, **DO update the md5_key in .env file to `guess_what`** so that former users will not lose their count, otherwise the count will start from 1.
